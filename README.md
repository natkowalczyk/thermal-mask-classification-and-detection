# Thermal mask on face classification and detection
Mask detection and classification in thermal face images


This repository allows to test mask detection and classification models on thermal images.


## Mask detection


## Mask classification
The proposed solution based on semi-supervised CNN with Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) was provided in the [classification folder](). To test the model you can used thermal images of three types of mask given in [images folder](https://github.com/natkowalczyk/thermal-mask-classification-and-detection/tree/main/images).
